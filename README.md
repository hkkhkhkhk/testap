# testap
A test platform for experimenting with vertical speed control using pitch.

This is a test using the SASL engine as a base, in creating a vertical speed hold cpntroller using cascade controllers with no overshoots. Note that this is for viewing only, may not work with other aircrafts with other copies of SASL as it depends a lot of factors on the aircraft itself, nor is it designed for public use.

This is the controller diagram of the project.

PLEASE DO NOT CONTACT ME FOR ERRORS, THIS PROJECT IS FOR SHOWCASING ONLY, NOT REAL APPLICATIONS.
